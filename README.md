# Java Design Patterns

This repository contains examples of popular design patterns implemented in Java. Design patterns are best practices that provide reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.

## Design Patterns Included

1. [Singleton Pattern](#singleton-pattern)
2. [Factory Pattern](#factory-pattern)
3. [Observer Pattern](#observer-pattern)
4. [Builder Pattern](#builder-pattern)
5. [Strategy Pattern](#strategy-pattern)

### Singleton Pattern
**Purpose:**  
The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

### Factory Pattern

**Purpose:** 
The Factory pattern defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

### Observer Pattern

**Purpose:** 
The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.

### Builder Pattern

**Purpose:** 
The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

### Strategy Pattern

**Purpose:** 
The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. The strategy pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it.
